    <h1>Default Parameters</h1>
    <h2>
      It is way of providing a default value to the paramters passed in a
      function, so that further problem doesn't occurs.
    </h2>
    <h3>The problem which may arise if we don't use default params are :-</h3>
    <h4>
      1 -> If either of the value isn't passed, it might return the result as
      NaN <br />
      2 -> In case of division and remainder, we might get result as infinity.
      etc...
