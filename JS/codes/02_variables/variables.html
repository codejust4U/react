      4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: <br />

      Using let <br />
    </h2>
    <p>
      The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015). <br />
      Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared. <br />

      Variables defined with let must be Declared before use. <br />
      Variables defined with let can be Reassigned.<br />
      Variables defined with let have Block Scope. <br />
    </p>
    <h2>Using const</h2>

    <p>
      The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).<br />
      Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.<br />
      Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.<br />
      Variables defined with const have Block Scope. <br />
      but if we declare an array with const, it doesn't give errors when modify
      the array item
    </p>

    <h2>Using var</h2>
    <p>
      Var is almost same as let but provide the functionality to use to block
      variable outside too.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules for naming a variable</h2>
    <p>
      1. Variables can start with alphabet i.e. [a-z,A-Z] but not with the
      number
      <br />
      2. can start with special characters i.e. $ and _ but not the other <br />
      3. can't give in between the variables name
    </p>
    <h2>Naming convention</h2>
    <p>
      1. camelCase - if we use two word, then first word's starting letter
      should be small and after that each word's starting letter should be
      capital i.e. firstName
      <br />
      2. snake_case - if we use two word, then after the 1st word give
      underscore to attach the afterwords i.e. first_name
      <br />
      3. kebab-case - two words is attached with hypen i.e. - example :
      first-name
      <br />
      4. PascalCase - 1st word's 1st letter also should be capital as well
      others too. Example FirstName
