    <h1>
      Mainly two types of data type i.e. <br />
      1. Primitive data type <br />
      2. Non-primitive data type
    </h1>
    <h2>
      primitive data types :-
      <br />
      1. Number - both integer and float, double are considered as number
      <br />
      2. String - charater, word is considered as string, but prefer the string
      declaration using backtick, coz it gives more features than single and
      double quote <br />
      3. Boolean - only two possibilties , true or false <br />
      4. Undefined - only one value i.e Undefined
      <br />
      5. Null - almost same as Undefined but js doesn't automatically puts, it's
      type is Object but can be considered as bug
